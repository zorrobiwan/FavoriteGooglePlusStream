Allow any Google+ user to set a Favorite Stream as default instead of the main one.

How to setup a favorite Stream ?
 - choose your favorite Stream and get its URL (right click - Copy Link Address)
 - open the "Favorite G+ Stream" extension configuration page by clicking on the "Stream" icon right to the address bar in Chrome and paste the Stream Id or its complete URL and click on "Save"

That's it.

Now, when you click on "Google+" or "Stream", your Favorite Stream is displayed instead of the main one.

To get the main Stream back, click on "Reset" under the config panel or disable this extension.
